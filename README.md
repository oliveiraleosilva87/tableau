<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- colocar apontamento para imagem ou link aqui [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is the branch were I'll put all my personal Tableau projects. They will be also uploaded in the Tableau Public cloud. Here you can:

* Check my latest Tableau updates
* Track my Tableau development progress
* See what I'm working on as a Data Analyst in my free time

I must say that I have worked some years with Tableau Desktop, so I have a little experience building dashboards already, but focused in quick results and showing the data as soon as it was possible to the companies. I'm not a sofisticated designer, but I'm always learning something new!

This is not my main activity right now, I present some Tableau classes but I'm currently not working with it every day, I'm trying to develop it in my free time.



### Built With

I mainly use Tableau Desktop to create and update dashboards to the Tableau Public cloud, but also MS Excel and SQL when needed

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can easily view all the projects running in the Tableau Public website and download it if you want to, of download this branch to make any other change and contribute with my dashboards creating a fork of it

### Prerequisites

To view the projects running in Tableau Public, no prerequisite is needed, but if you wish to download and edit any project, you will need to:

* Download Tableau Desktop software (you can download a trial or a one-year free version for students)
* Download the datasource which is used in the desired dashboard (I'll be always using public datasources, having them published in my Kaggle profile or at least a link to it, so you can download and run the dashboard)

### Installation

You can follow the steps below to download Tableau Desktop and run any project:
1. Create a account in Tableau website
2. Download Tableau Desktop latest version at [Tableau Website](https://www.tableau.com/pt-br/products/desktop/download)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

I could surely create a waterfall chart using PMI project framework or even a Product Roadmap based in the Scrum Agile Framework, but I'll keep it simple, since will only update this project in my free time and making a complex schedule could lead me to a outdated documentation

- [x] Create GitHub project branch
- [x] Update a first fork of an existing Tableau project
- [ ] Create a project from scratch using a public dataset
- [ ] Explore any cool feature in Tableau Public and create a new project using it
- [ ] Create a new Tableau project using a data pipeline of mine and keep it running using AWS free tier if possible
    - [ ] Find a dataset or public API
    - [ ] Create a data pipeline for data cleansing
    - [ ] Create a Tableau dashboard using the cleared data
